featureType: bathymetry grid
title: todays Bathymetry grid
summary: >
 This is today's gridded bathymetry.  This is created for use in the Coastal Model Test bed.  This is an evolving
 grid updated with the most recent dune and pier lidar topography as well as the most recent survey FRF survey bathymetry.  User must be aware that positional coordinate error grows with distance from FRF origin.
