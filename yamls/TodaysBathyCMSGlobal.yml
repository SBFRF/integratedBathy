featureType: bathymetry grid
title: todays Bathymetry grid
summary: >
 This is today's gridded bathymetry.  This is created for use in the Coastal Model Test bed.  this is an evolving
 grid updated with the most recent bathymetry that are measured using the FRF monthly surveys if not more often
 during projects.  User must be aware that positional coordinate error grows with distance from FRF origin, due to
 assumptions made in coordinate conversions
